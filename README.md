# AutogenDeepDive
Here is my update on Microsoft Autogen. Last time I was pretty hopeful that it would perform well. It's not perfect and has a LONG way to go but it is the best thing out there right now. I find myself using it more and wanted to share some code with everyone to get you started down the Autogen road as well. Keep in mind that this is a tool, kind of like a hammer, and, at first, everything will look like a nail. Over time you will figure out what the limitations are and how to work around them or just go back to interactive chat. Either way I hope you take time to see what can be done with multi-agent frameworks like Autogen.

I've attached three Python files:
AutoGenIsYourFriend.py -- This is the first into file and it is packed with my comments to get you started.
AutoGenIsYourFriend2.py -- This is the same core as the into file but with more advanced techniques employed.
MultiAgentMadness.py -- This is the most advanced multi-agent file in the group. It showcases many more advanced techniques. It will take a while to master this one but I've given you some comments to help get you started. Since each run is slightly different, I've also included a video of my most recent run of this file to compare to your run. Enjoy!
